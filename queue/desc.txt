A queue can be seen as similar to the ticket queue outside a cinema hall. Queue follows the FIFO principle - the item that goes in first is the item that comes out first.

Putting items in the queue - enqueue
Removing items from the queue - dequeue

Queue allows the following operations:
- Enqueue
- Dequeue
- IsEmpty
- IsFull
- Peek
